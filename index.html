        <p>This is a small website based around small JS Clock tutorial that quickly
            grew into an exercise in building a small website. The nav bar was also created
            with a tutorial, and link to other small exercises and pojects.
            <br><br>
            Building small sites like this is a worthwile exercise as it helps 
            affirm my identity as a web developer.
            <br><br>
            This was created using CSS without any preproccessing and I now understand why 
            people love preproccessing. I have been spoiled by it. For this project I simply
            used comments to keep track of what CSS belongs to what HTML pages, but with LESS
            you can use many LESS pages to keep track of it for you. I started out doing this
            but had trouble with linking the different CSS paths to each sheet, something I 
            need to work on (but maybe not if LESS or SASS is industry standard. Would be for
            my knowledge only).
            <br><br>
            To make these paragraph breaks I am actually only using one paragraph element in 
            each article and using a double line of line-break elements.
            <br><br>
            If you want to see something neat, scroll down and watch each heading replace
            each other heading on the page. This happenes because using the sticky element 
            can only remain fixed inside of it's parent element.
