# Analog-Clock

6-30-2019

Lambda School is kicking my ass. We are on break this next week but I do not want to fall behind more than I already feel, so I am building a ton of mini-projects to reinforce what I know. 

This project was a suggestion from user Pradman#1908 on the Grind Reel/Joshua Fluke Discord.

I ended up firstly doing a CSS Position tutorial since in the description of the 
clock tutorial he mentions "we will be covering CSS position, and transform extensively"

I pushed this to github and now I am going follow along with this next tutorial that goes more in depth with the sticky position. I remember making a nav using the sticky position and expect that I will use it in the future. Deeper knowledge will not hurt.
